ðŸš§ Work in progress â€“ actively improving this minimal HTTP server built with TypeScript and native Node.js.

ðŸ›  raw-node-ts-server-starter is a personal learning project that demonstrates how to build a lightweight, framework-free HTTP server using TypeScript and the native http module in Node.js. It includes modular routing, in-memory data handling, JSON parsing, and full ESM support â€” all organized with a clean project structure and strict TypeScript configuration.
